<p id="block-77da266e-044b-4033-ba05-5e14e67d578e">The vast majority of people in Europe are in support of Ukraine against the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Everyone is coming together to help Ukraine, even governments are making U-turns in policy to help Ukraine on aid, military, and refugee support. But why? Why is this more important than wars in the middle east, many of them exacerbated by western intervention?</p>



<p id="block-00159294-009c-4b0c-837f-3dcde3ee5e01"><strong>World Wars.&nbsp;</strong>If you take a look at history, the two world wars started in Europe. We know that the past wars that have started in Europe have led to world wars. Furthermore, wars in the middle east would unlikely form into a world war. I am fairly certain that the thought of a world war never crossed your mind when the first news report of middle-eastern conflicts were shown to you. Whereas, many of you already know the difference in feeling from waking up to the news that Russia invaded Ukraine. This is the biggest reason why it is very important to not downplay this invasion.</p>



<p id="block-43c5bcac-43b1-420a-925a-c9284dd48720"><strong>Regional dominance</strong>. Russia already has influence everywhere and has waged wars in the past 30 years. However, the difference in the invasion of Ukraine is that Russia is intending to extend its borders further west, encroaching on western democracies. This is much different from Russia’s and the US’s invasions of the middle east, where they sought to change regime and influence only – not to extend their borders. There is also a risk that not standing up to Russia at this point will empower Russian leaders to go further into Europe and empower other powerful countries to take military action in other parts of the world. Thus, a Russian war with NATO is not the most dangerous situation, but not standing up to aggressors is.</p>



<p>In addition, Ukraine recently has found natural gas deposits which would compete with Russia in the sale of gas to Europe. Allowing Russia to have this natural resource will give them more power and more revenue. Giving them the ammunition to make ultimatums to the west.</p>



<p id="block-1d5335d9-3ffb-47dc-9881-54367a14d79b"><strong>The refugee crisis.&nbsp;</strong>Let us not be naïve to think that Europe has not had refugees since the world war. Refugees from Syria have been on the lips of European politicians, most trying to limit the amount they take. But when it comes to Ukraine, everyone is opening up with open arms! Make no mistake, the current Ukrainian refugee crisis will be far larger than that seen from the middle east (660k fled during the first week of the conflict). This is due to the location of Ukraine being in Europe, thus, Europe has no choice but to accept them – because the alternatives Belarus or Russia.</p>



<p id="block-f55a21d9-230e-46e2-b48b-41735fdaf8f4">P<strong>opulation unity. </strong>Unlike other wars, which have been based on the fractioning of the population into different sides. The people of Ukraine are almost unilaterally against Russian occupation. Indeed, the western media may be inflating this statement. But I highly doubt that people in Ukraine want Russian occupation now that they are shelling their homes, otherwise they would not need to invade. Russian soldiers that were told they would be welcomed with flowers have realised this.</p>



<p id="block-82822881-56b1-4100-8ca7-6a3e83a0d1c3">For those of you who are still unconvinced from my comments, let me remind you that this invasion is involving more troops and equipment than any war in a generation. It also has the potential to escalate and overflow into your territory – the potential for it to involve many more people is high. Raising awareness is important to limit this potential as the casualties in the first week are already in the 1000s. Not to mention the possible nuclear fallout.</p>



<p id="block-21e15810-6f3b-45d5-a44b-e91d9fd2e147">Therefore, please do not say it is not as important as other wars. It might just be a matter of time that a shell lands on everyone’s doorstep, especially if you live in Europe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Due to the crisis in Ukraine, many of the Ukrainian community have been invited to talk on the TV and radio. I was approached by a radio station to do an interview. I was aired in short 10 second bursts during the news bulletins on the planetradio network (stations include: greatest hits, gem etc.). However, please read the full interview below.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="summary-transcript">Summary Transcript</h2>



<p>00:00:00.000 –&gt; 00:00:03.200<br>Reporter<br>Can you just start with your full name and where you’re from please?</p>



<p>00:00:03.200 –&gt; 00:00:07.200</p>



<p>Peter Stasiw<br>Can I say my Ukrainian name? Petro Stasiw and I’m from Derby.</p>



<p>00:00:17.400 –&gt; 00:00:24.470<br>Reporter<br>Okie Dokes. Can we just start with a little bit about your background as in you know where you were born and how long you’ve been here?</p>



<p>00:00:24.460 –&gt; 00:00:38.140<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>Yeah. I was born here, and my parents are born here, and all my grandparents came here after the war. And so, a few of them were liberated from some of the labour camps if they were taken there and others came and joined later.</p>



<p>00:00:40.340 –&gt; 00:00:45.780<br>Reporter<br>So obviously big in the news is the escalating situation in Ukraine.<br>First of all, your reaction to that, how do you feel about it all?</p>



<p>00:00:52.070 –&gt; 00:01:16.620<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>So it’s not new news that Russia always being aggressive to Ukraine over so many years. Nothing has changed really. And the only thing that stayed the same is a kind of a dictator figure in control of that Russian area. It doesn’t matter what they’re called Russia, Soviet Union, whoever was in charge of that area, it’s always being aggressive toward Ukraine.</p>



<p>00:01:18.400 –&gt; 00:01:25.790<br>Reporter<br>So are you effectively saying, you know this is what you’re used to? This is, this is how the people live there.</p>



<p>00:01:26.770 –&gt; 00:01:28.630<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>Yeah. We’re kind of fed up with it and that’s how we’ve lived for so many years and now since 2014, since then I think that was the pinnacle of everything. We kind of moved away from Russia and were going in the right path towards the West, towards democracy, less corruption and I think from this point it was all good and we were finding the right path to could get kind of protection from west.</p>



<p>00:02:02.840 –&gt; 00:02:09.340<br>Reporter<br>So do you still have connections direct connections in in Ukraine with friends and family?</p>



<p>00:02:09.890 –&gt; 00:02:36.800<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>I’m not direct connections in Ukraine and I do have ancestral cousins, sort of that connection. And I’m still in touch with some of the relatives that in Poland because after the war, they changed the borders. And so that area of Poland was Ukraine. I’m still in touch with them, but no one directly in Ukraine. And it’s my homeland, so I’d try and do everything. You know, spread the message out and try to raise awareness.</p>



<p>00:02:47.990 –&gt; 00:03:06.680<br>Reporter<br>So what will the people that you’re in touch with, what is the mood like? You know? Are they scared? Are they worried or is this, as you say, a way of life? And actually, it’s just because of the media attention that we’re getting. We’re getting fed all of this, that that it seems, uh, a bigger deal.</p>



<p>00:03:07.640 –&gt; 00:03:08.910<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>Exactly, when you talk to them that it’s like it’s nothing new. Like everything is horrible in war. Lots of my older cousins who are like my grandparents’ age know how it was back in the war when there was fight against the Germans and Russians. And obviously it wasn’t a good thing, but it seems to just be Russia trying to get influence and they they kind of used to it. Of course, no one really wants it, but that’s why when you hear all these news reports about no one’s really panicking ’cause they’re so used to it.</p>



<p>00:03:58.000 –&gt; 00:04:01.900<br>Reporter<br>Yes. So they’ve got a higher tolerance to this than us.</p>



<p>00:04:00.990 –&gt; 00:04:01.730<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>Exactly.</p>



<p>00:04:03.220 –&gt; 00:04:10.090<br>Reporter<br>And how does it make you feel that that you’re, you know, a UK citizen and not having to live like this?</p>



<p>00:04:15.380 –&gt; 00:04:20.990<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>Kind of maybe lucky because over here is and there’s no real threat of war. That’s about it really. But it’s 21st century. It shouldn’t be like this in any country in the world.</p>



<p>00:04:30.980 –&gt; 00:04:36.200<br>Reporter<br>What do you predict may or may not happen over the next few days?</p>



<p>00:04:37.050 –&gt; 00:05:00.900<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>I don’t think much is going to happen over next few days and because everyone knows what’s going to happen. If someone knew your plan, you’re not going to carry it out. So I think it’s just probably a warning and maybe he’s put in as you know, trained all these troops and they will come back next month, come back next year.<br>Putin is trying to see the opportunity. So like with Crimea, when he illegally annexed it in 2014, he’s just looking for that opportunity when the eyes are the West are looking out somewhere and then he will strike over. If everyone knows that he might invade, everyone throwing weapons and everyone is getting ready. The whole Ukrainian population is getting armed then he is not going to do it. He is gonna do it when everyone starts relaxing.<br>I think Putin is just bullying and see what it can get until the final Cliff edge, but that’s dangerous game. So anything, anything that could have started a war. A stray bullet could have started it. It’s kind of living dangerously.</p>



<p>00:05:53.130 –&gt; 00:05:53.890<br>Reporter<br>Living on the edge and is there anything else that you would like to add. All that you’ve not mentioned ’cause I’m not that immersed in it. You know I’m sort of dipping my toe in the water because it’s a big news story at the moment, you know?</p>



<p>00:06:07.730 –&gt; 00:06:12.740<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>Lots of people think, oh, Ukraine, Russia, same people. And so we might have same roots, but we’re not the same people. And it goes back if you go back 1000 years then, and it was, it was a land called the Kievan Rus. And the Kievan Rus was ruled by some kind of Viking kings. That’s how it’s set up.</p>



<p>00:06:32.350 –&gt; 00:06:45.040<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>And Russia at this time wasn’t even started. Meanwhile, Ukraine was being mentioned, people calling their land Ukraine. It was an area of the Kievan Rus.</p>



<p>00:06:45.940 –&gt; 00:06:49.810<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>And it wasn’t until there was some kind of break up with the rulers at that time where one of them went over and formed in the Principality of Moscow, so it wasn’t until after Ukraine was kind of formed until Russia was formed. So Putin with his essay said we are one people: Russia and Ukraine, Maybe that is true, but Ukrainians then have as much claim to Russia as Russia to claiming Ukraine.</p>



<p>00:07:16.860 –&gt; 00:07:23.530<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>We have different cultures and people say, oh, there’s lots of people speaking Russian and Ukraine, that’s true.<br>Well, it’s like people speaking English in and US or anything. It doesn’t mean that they’re English and are the same. There probably would be more Ukrainians speaking Ukrainian. But there was a genocide in 1932 to 1933. I’m not sure if you know, it’s called the Holodomor where Starlin basically took all the wheat produce in the Ukrainian lands. And people starved to death. And that was ethnic cleansing. So once lots of Ukrainians died, forced were lots of ethnic Russians from the Moscow area into Ukraine.<br>And then, of course, they’re going to speak Russian, not Ukrainian. So the actual fact that over there might be Russians in Ukraine. It’s because Ukraine were killed and Russians put there.<br>I think that’s a big misconception that people have.</p>



<p>00:08:30.780 –&gt; 00:08:55.770<br>Reporter<br>Absolutely. So in terms of the amount of stuff that we’re gonna use. We’re very sound bitey so we could, we could talk for way longer, but I won’t be able to use it. So I think probably just to end to kind of going back to this situation that we are seeing and talking about and the reason we’re doing this and if we if you can just summarize then in general.</p>



<p>00:08:59.990 –&gt; 00:09:07.850<br>Reporter<br>How it is our interpretation here and how it will compare to how it feels for the people there?</p>



<p>00:09:08.540 –&gt; 00:09:14.430<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>Ukraine, I don’t know how many miles away is. Why should we care? The choice is simple, democracy and peace compared to the opposite, with Putin in the east and dictatorship in Belarus, in the north. That’s basically it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It is headline news that over 100,000 Russian troops are amassed near the Ukraine-Russia border. It does not take a genius to work-out that this is what happens before a war begins. But it is important to note that Ukraine has been fighting a low-intensity hybrid war against Russian forces in its eastern Donbas region, ever since Vladimir Putin, the Russian President, provided arms and resources to ‘separatists’ in east Ukraine – a cover up of the fact that these ‘separatists’ are probably Russian military, wearing Russian military uniform without the insignia. This is also the case in illegally-annexed Crimea. A now erased Russian court case inadvertently confirmed the official existence of Russian regular troops operating in occupied Ukrainian territory.  The only ongoing war in Europe has taken the lives of 14,000 Ukrainians and has displaced millions more.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1920" height="2517" src="https://www.peterstasiw.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Map_of_the_war_in_Donbass.svg_.png" alt="" class="wp-image-32"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Military situation in November 2021 | Stalemate since 2015</em></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Ukraine?</h2>



<p>But why is Ukraine so interesting to Putin? Very simple – a buffer zone between democracy and autocracy. Russia sees Ukraine as a battleground for if there was ever a battle between the east and west. In WW2 for example, Ukraine was the main battle ground between the soviets and the axis powers. Why bring the battle to your own border, when you can have Ukraine as a battleground instead? This is the main reason why Putin does not want Ukraine to become a NATO member, as he would never be able to claim Ukraine without a whole NATO alliance getting involved.</p>



<p>Other reasons to conquer Ukraine:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Direct gas pipeline to Europe</li>



<li>Large land mass</li>



<li>25th most powerful army in the world</li>



<li>Join occupied Crimea to the Russian mainland (Crimea was annexed back in 2014, primarily due to its warm-water ports and access to the Black Sea, a place that Russia can use to move its navy year-round whilst its other harbours are frozen in winter. However, Crimea is not self-sufficient, hence the need to join it with Russia)</li>



<li>Natural resources like minerals, oil, coal, natural gas, Uranium (most of which is in the occupied Donbas region)</li>



<li>Extremely fertile land (which is why grain is a major export)</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The History</h2>



<p>History, of course, plays a crucial role in the events of today. Vladimir Putin has revealed in an article he wrote, entitled&nbsp;<em>‘On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians’,&nbsp;</em>as well as in a recent interview, that he believes that Ukrainians and Russians are ‘one people’ and that Ukraine is a ‘breakaway province’ of Russia that should be united through diplomacy or force. On this premise, Ukrainians have the same claim that Russia should be part of Ukraine, rather than Ukraine part of Russia. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union in the 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century and had been absorbed by the Russian Empire before that, leading to an entangled history between the two ethnicities. Yet, it is important to note that most Ukrainians see themselves as distinct from Russians, and have a separate language, culture, and social mindset, as well as a separate independent history, in which Russia is viewed as an oppressive occupying foreign power. Putin seeks to end the embarrassment of the Soviet Union’s collapse and restore ‘historical Russian lands’ to their former glory.</p>



<p>But let us go back a thousand years to the Kyivan Rus. The Kyvian domain of the entire Rus was formed with the help of Normans, and the general Slavic population originating from migration over 100s of years from various places, but definitely not from the North East where Russia is today. See the confusion? ‘Rus’ and ‘Russia’. No one would blame you for making the connection, and this is how Russia like to claim history when they are entirely different. Some Ukrainians even refer to Russians as Muscovites, rather than Russian, and I will explain why.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="2250" height="2781" src="https://www.peterstasiw.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/download.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-33"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Kyivan Rus 980-1054 https://euromaidanpress.com/2016/11/05/princess-olha-of-kyiv-a-golden-page-in-ukrainian-history/</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the northeast, Vladimir-Suzdal&nbsp;(and later Moscow) formed the core from which developed the future Russian state. But this state did not form until second half of the 13th century. In addition, it was formed under the leadership of a branch of the Rurik&nbsp;dynasty. The Rurik dynasty were the princes of the Kyivan Rus and descendents of varangian (viking) prince Rurik. Meanwhile, Ukraine was first mentioned in the Hypatian Codex in 1187 as the name of the territory of Pereyaslav Principality meaning “outskirts”, and later the term expanded to other parts of the Kyivan Rus. Ukraine has always been centred around Kyiv (the former capital of the Kyivan Rus), Ukraine stands on much of the historic Kyivan Rus, and Russia is just a later off-branch. Thus, Russia is in fact a break-away province of Ukraine.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The topic of Crimea</h2>



<p>I would argue that Crimea is neither Ukrainian nor Russian, but the land of the Crimean Tatars. Nonetheless, Crimea has been part of Ukraine under autonomous status in harmony with Ukraine. That was until Russia invaded and took over everything. Now Crimea has no autonomy and is ruled by Russia, despite their installation of a puppet government.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Language</h2>



<p>Yes, language laws were passed in Ukraine which requires Ukrainian to be the language of study in state schools. The point of the law is that institutions should use the Ukrainian language. Some laws also have quotas on how many Ukrainian songs should be played on the radio and quotas in other media including books. No one is denying that people speak Russian in Ukraine, but this is exactly the problem. This dilutes the Ukrainian culture, and increases the chance for Russian influence. No one is banning Russian, Ukraine is just putting a limit on it so it cannot take over the culture. It is a right of a country that its citizens use the national language above all others. I, myself, speak Ukrainian at home and watch films with Ukrainian dubbing (when possible), just because of the fact it is a beautiful language.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the claim that Putin is ‘defending Russian speakers’ is false. Many Russian-speaking Ukrainians spoke out against the Kremlin’s military intervention in Ukraine, rejecting Russian claims of any rights violations. Thousands more went even further, taking up arms against Russian hybrid forces in the east of the country.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The verdict</h2>



<p>Putin is a bully. Many Russians do not want war, nor do they want Ukraine. They even took to the streets in 2014 against the start of the war back then. Putin is doing all of these actions to distract the rest of the Russian population from the corruption and scandal of his own government, and even to leave a legacy of conquering another country.</p>



<p>However, Ukrainians are proud, even my gran would pick up a gun and fight if she had to. So if Russia invades, they will be met with extensive resistance.</p>
