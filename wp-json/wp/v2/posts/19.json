But there have been rumours that the next camera the GH6 coming out soon. This GH line-up of cameras uses the micro four thirds sensor (MFT), which is half the size of the full frame sensor of most other mirrorless cameras. The prices of full frame cameras are reducing and they have their advantages. Why should I stay with GH MFT line-up and not switch to the full frame cameras?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Panasonic GH6 Complete Specifications\" width=\"880\" height=\"495\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ax0snEc_9IE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a video which has the rumoured specs and debate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reasons for:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Smaller, lighter and cheaper lenses (smaller sensor requires smaller lenses)<\/li><li>More processing features, because the camera has more space for hardware (such as higher resolution at higher bitrates)<\/li><li>I already own some MFT lenses (so full frame lenses will be an extra expense)<\/li><li>I&#8217;m only a amateur camera enthusiast, so I do not need anything OTT<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reasons against:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Prices of full frame are coming down, when the GH6 is released I anticipate it will be more expensive than an entry-level full frame.<\/li><li>Full frame is much better in the dark<\/li><li>MFT may lose popularity and support for them may diminish<\/li><li>MFT uses depth-from-defocus autofocus which is worse than the mainstream contrast autofocus used in most other cameras.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We do not have any confirmed specifications yet, and if the price is right I may buy it.
