<p>A very safe city with plenty of cultural things to do.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="5677" height="3833" src="https://www.peterstasiw.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Copenhagen-085.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-62" style="width:876px;height:auto"/></figure>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Main Tips</h1>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Ride the metro from the airport to the city and back, it is much cheaper than a taxi, even for four people.</li>



<li>Despite it being a very walkable city, I would suggest to rent a bike (usually hotels have some) to get around. It will speed up your travel and you will be able to fit in more activities. This city is often ranked highly for bike-friendliness, experiencing this should be part of your trip.</li>



<li>The cost of goods and services here are approximately 1.5x that of London &#8211; so save beforehand.</li>
</ul>



<p>  </p>



<p>   </p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Activities</h1>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Home of Carlsberg</h3>



<p>I experienced both the &#8216;Exhibition&#8217; and &#8216;Exploring Carlsberg&#8217; Tour. The former is a self-guided interior tour which sequentially takes you through various rooms about the history of Carlsberg. Most rooms had a large screen where videos of actors portraying the founders of the company are played &#8211; it really complemented the exhibits which would have otherwise be sparse. You also get a free glass of Carlsberg at the end!</p>

<p>The &#8216;Exploring Carlsberg&#8217; tour is a 60-min walking employee-guided tour around the grounds of the Carlsberg area. The tour-guide explanation delved deeper into the personalities of the main people of Carlsberg and offered the opportunity to ask questions. During my tour, there were a couple of Danish men who grilled the tour guide which made things interesting. One of the interesting things I learnt is that Carlsberg used the swastika as a symbol on many things (their statues and even bottle labels) prior to the desecration by the Nazis.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="6022" height="4016" src="https://www.peterstasiw.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Copenhagen-039.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-67"/></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">War Museum</h3>



<p>If you do not like museums, I am unsure that you would like the war museum. It would be a bit boring for the normal folk. </p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="6000" height="4000" src="https://www.peterstasiw.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Copenhagen-091-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-70 size-full"/></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>However, if you are a museum fan then you would enjoy it here, the first floor has countless model wooden ships (around the size of a human) and takes you through the Danish war history including weapons and different uniforms. It also had an interesting exhibit of Afghanistan and the less-known contribution of Danish forces there.</p>
</div></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hop on Hop off Bus Tour</h3>



<p>I think this is something you should do in any city you visit. It makes sure that you do not miss anything and can be used as transport to the main attractions. Red sightseeing operate in this city which also has an app to track the busses, so I would recommend it. For only £5 extra I went on a boat tour operated by a sister company which took me on a lovely cruise of the canals.</p>



<p>     </p>



<p>   </p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Places of Interest</h1>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Little Mermaid</h3>



<div class="wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile"><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>This famous statue is situated quite north of the Copenhagen river. I would recommend to get here by bus &#8211; since it is quite a distance away from other attractions. There are other sculptures in the same area within the 2 minute walk of each other.</p>
</div><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="3483" height="2542" src="https://www.peterstasiw.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Copenhagen-077-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-72 size-full"/></figure></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Danish Houses of Parliament</h3>



<p>This building has a ruins section and viewing of reception rooms, although when we walked by we discovered that is is closed on Mondays.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Frederiksberg Palace</h3>



<p>This palace has beautiful surroundings with perfect spots for picturesque photos. The landscaped gardens also feature an artificial river. There is also a zoo or a palace tour if you&#8217;re into that. You could spend countless hours here, maybe less on a bike.</p>

</figure>
</div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Copenhagen City Hall</h3>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="6022" height="4016" src="https://www.peterstasiw.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Copenhagen-062.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-81 size-full"/></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>This magnificent building also offers tours. The square where this is situated is very large and the surrounding shops are include worldwide well-known brands (KFC, hard rock café, McDonalds etc). Close by is Tivoli gardens &#8211; one of the oldest theme parks in the world.</p>
</div></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dantes Plads</h3>



<div class="wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile"><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>This sculpture was built by the locals as a sign of opposition to the government that planned on building a car park there. This is best viewed at night as it is the stuff of nightmares! Across the road is the Carlsberg Glyptotek, and adjacent is the restaurant &#8216;Karla&#8217; which is very authentic.</p>
</div><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="6022" height="4016" src="https://www.peterstasiw.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Copenhagen-061.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-83 size-full"/></figure></div>



<p>  </p>



<p>  </p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Food</h1>



<p>The famous cuisine here is &#8216;smorgasbord&#8217; which are open sandwiches with many toppings on. I liken it to sushi on bread as many toppings include fish. NOTE: these are only available in the lunch menu of all restaurants (12 &#8211; 5pm).<br>The most common toppings included breaded plaice, shrimp (with boiled eggs), salmon (with cream cheese), marinated herring (with salad) and beef slices. They vary in price from restaurant to restaurant from around £8 to £20 a sandwich. The bread they use for the base is a dense rye seeded bread, which does fill you up but is still expensive.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="6022" height="4016" data-id="92" src="https://www.peterstasiw.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Copenhagen-081.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-92"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="5260" height="2740" data-id="93" src="https://www.peterstasiw.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Copenhagen-083.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-93"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="6022" height="4016" data-id="91" src="https://www.peterstasiw.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Copenhagen-006.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-91"/></figure>

</figure>



<p>Other than smorgasbord, like in the restaurant &#8216;Karla&#8217;, you will find traditional &#8216;homely&#8217; dishes like schnitzel, plaice, pork etc all with potatoes and vegetables. Although I had trouble finding these sorts of places, as most restaurants weren&#8217;t of domestic cuisine or smorgasbord. </p>



<p>Breakfast here included a plethora of Danish pastries. There are many coffee houses and bakeries about so these are not hard to find.</p>



<p>  </p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Copenhagen in General</h1>



<p>Compared to other countries, Denmark is ranked highly on the level of English spoken in the world. Thus, communicating was not an issue, and pretty much every sign or notice with writing had the Danish and English language.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile"><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>Unlike other cities where I took my lovely night photos, Copenhagen was not at night which prevented me from getting a nice night shot on the river. Nonetheless, streets are lit up sufficiently.</p>
</div><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="6022" height="4016" src="https://www.peterstasiw.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Copenhagen-010.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-95 size-full"/></figure></div>



<p>The people are very friendly and want to help. Despite being tourists, no response to &#8216;Excuse me&#8217; was met with a sour face.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:30% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="6022" height="4016" src="https://www.peterstasiw.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Copenhagen-026.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-94 size-full"/></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>Safe safe safe! I would not feel unsafe walking in this city at night. There did not seem to be any suspicious activity going on such as groups of youths in hoods, and I only ever experienced one whiff of marijuana (close to the hotel) in my entire trip. When compared to London at night, it is a completely different place. I only saw one or two bikes out of the thousands parked up that had locks on them, and even then they were locked to their own frame. I did not encounter any homeless person (since I hear there are many shelters) and no beggars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p id="block-77da266e-044b-4033-ba05-5e14e67d578e">The vast majority of people in Europe are in support of Ukraine against the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Everyone is coming together to help Ukraine, even governments are making U-turns in policy to help Ukraine on aid, military, and refugee support. But why? Why is this more important than wars in the middle east, many of them exacerbated by western intervention?</p>



<p id="block-00159294-009c-4b0c-837f-3dcde3ee5e01"><strong>World Wars.&nbsp;</strong>If you take a look at history, the two world wars started in Europe. We know that the past wars that have started in Europe have led to world wars. Furthermore, wars in the middle east would unlikely form into a world war. I am fairly certain that the thought of a world war never crossed your mind when the first news report of middle-eastern conflicts were shown to you. Whereas, many of you already know the difference in feeling from waking up to the news that Russia invaded Ukraine. This is the biggest reason why it is very important to not downplay this invasion.</p>



<p id="block-43c5bcac-43b1-420a-925a-c9284dd48720"><strong>Regional dominance</strong>. Russia already has influence everywhere and has waged wars in the past 30 years. However, the difference in the invasion of Ukraine is that Russia is intending to extend its borders further west, encroaching on western democracies. This is much different from Russia’s and the US’s invasions of the middle east, where they sought to change regime and influence only – not to extend their borders. There is also a risk that not standing up to Russia at this point will empower Russian leaders to go further into Europe and empower other powerful countries to take military action in other parts of the world. Thus, a Russian war with NATO is not the most dangerous situation, but not standing up to aggressors is.</p>



<p>In addition, Ukraine recently has found natural gas deposits which would compete with Russia in the sale of gas to Europe. Allowing Russia to have this natural resource will give them more power and more revenue. Giving them the ammunition to make ultimatums to the west.</p>



<p id="block-1d5335d9-3ffb-47dc-9881-54367a14d79b"><strong>The refugee crisis.&nbsp;</strong>Let us not be naïve to think that Europe has not had refugees since the world war. Refugees from Syria have been on the lips of European politicians, most trying to limit the amount they take. But when it comes to Ukraine, everyone is opening up with open arms! Make no mistake, the current Ukrainian refugee crisis will be far larger than that seen from the middle east (660k fled during the first week of the conflict). This is due to the location of Ukraine being in Europe, thus, Europe has no choice but to accept them – because the alternatives Belarus or Russia.</p>



<p id="block-f55a21d9-230e-46e2-b48b-41735fdaf8f4">P<strong>opulation unity. </strong>Unlike other wars, which have been based on the fractioning of the population into different sides. The people of Ukraine are almost unilaterally against Russian occupation. Indeed, the western media may be inflating this statement. But I highly doubt that people in Ukraine want Russian occupation now that they are shelling their homes, otherwise they would not need to invade. Russian soldiers that were told they would be welcomed with flowers have realised this.</p>



<p id="block-82822881-56b1-4100-8ca7-6a3e83a0d1c3">For those of you who are still unconvinced from my comments, let me remind you that this invasion is involving more troops and equipment than any war in a generation. It also has the potential to escalate and overflow into your territory – the potential for it to involve many more people is high. Raising awareness is important to limit this potential as the casualties in the first week are already in the 1000s. Not to mention the possible nuclear fallout.</p>



<p id="block-21e15810-6f3b-45d5-a44b-e91d9fd2e147">Therefore, please do not say it is not as important as other wars. It might just be a matter of time that a shell lands on everyone’s doorstep, especially if you live in Europe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Due to the crisis in Ukraine, many of the Ukrainian community have been invited to talk on the TV and radio. I was approached by a radio station to do an interview. I was aired in short 10 second bursts during the news bulletins on the planetradio network (stations include: greatest hits, gem etc.). However, please read the full interview below.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="summary-transcript">Summary Transcript</h2>



<p>00:00:00.000 –&gt; 00:00:03.200<br>Reporter<br>Can you just start with your full name and where you’re from please?</p>



<p>00:00:03.200 –&gt; 00:00:07.200</p>



<p>Peter Stasiw<br>Can I say my Ukrainian name? Petro Stasiw and I’m from Derby.</p>



<p>00:00:17.400 –&gt; 00:00:24.470<br>Reporter<br>Okie Dokes. Can we just start with a little bit about your background as in you know where you were born and how long you’ve been here?</p>



<p>00:00:24.460 –&gt; 00:00:38.140<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>Yeah. I was born here, and my parents are born here, and all my grandparents came here after the war. And so, a few of them were liberated from some of the labour camps if they were taken there and others came and joined later.</p>



<p>00:00:40.340 –&gt; 00:00:45.780<br>Reporter<br>So obviously big in the news is the escalating situation in Ukraine.<br>First of all, your reaction to that, how do you feel about it all?</p>



<p>00:00:52.070 –&gt; 00:01:16.620<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>So it’s not new news that Russia always being aggressive to Ukraine over so many years. Nothing has changed really. And the only thing that stayed the same is a kind of a dictator figure in control of that Russian area. It doesn’t matter what they’re called Russia, Soviet Union, whoever was in charge of that area, it’s always being aggressive toward Ukraine.</p>



<p>00:01:18.400 –&gt; 00:01:25.790<br>Reporter<br>So are you effectively saying, you know this is what you’re used to? This is, this is how the people live there.</p>



<p>00:01:26.770 –&gt; 00:01:28.630<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>Yeah. We’re kind of fed up with it and that’s how we’ve lived for so many years and now since 2014, since then I think that was the pinnacle of everything. We kind of moved away from Russia and were going in the right path towards the West, towards democracy, less corruption and I think from this point it was all good and we were finding the right path to could get kind of protection from west.</p>



<p>00:02:02.840 –&gt; 00:02:09.340<br>Reporter<br>So do you still have connections direct connections in in Ukraine with friends and family?</p>



<p>00:02:09.890 –&gt; 00:02:36.800<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>I’m not direct connections in Ukraine and I do have ancestral cousins, sort of that connection. And I’m still in touch with some of the relatives that in Poland because after the war, they changed the borders. And so that area of Poland was Ukraine. I’m still in touch with them, but no one directly in Ukraine. And it’s my homeland, so I’d try and do everything. You know, spread the message out and try to raise awareness.</p>



<p>00:02:47.990 –&gt; 00:03:06.680<br>Reporter<br>So what will the people that you’re in touch with, what is the mood like? You know? Are they scared? Are they worried or is this, as you say, a way of life? And actually, it’s just because of the media attention that we’re getting. We’re getting fed all of this, that that it seems, uh, a bigger deal.</p>



<p>00:03:07.640 –&gt; 00:03:08.910<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>Exactly, when you talk to them that it’s like it’s nothing new. Like everything is horrible in war. Lots of my older cousins who are like my grandparents’ age know how it was back in the war when there was fight against the Germans and Russians. And obviously it wasn’t a good thing, but it seems to just be Russia trying to get influence and they they kind of used to it. Of course, no one really wants it, but that’s why when you hear all these news reports about no one’s really panicking ’cause they’re so used to it.</p>



<p>00:03:58.000 –&gt; 00:04:01.900<br>Reporter<br>Yes. So they’ve got a higher tolerance to this than us.</p>



<p>00:04:00.990 –&gt; 00:04:01.730<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>Exactly.</p>



<p>00:04:03.220 –&gt; 00:04:10.090<br>Reporter<br>And how does it make you feel that that you’re, you know, a UK citizen and not having to live like this?</p>



<p>00:04:15.380 –&gt; 00:04:20.990<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>Kind of maybe lucky because over here is and there’s no real threat of war. That’s about it really. But it’s 21st century. It shouldn’t be like this in any country in the world.</p>



<p>00:04:30.980 –&gt; 00:04:36.200<br>Reporter<br>What do you predict may or may not happen over the next few days?</p>



<p>00:04:37.050 –&gt; 00:05:00.900<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>I don’t think much is going to happen over next few days and because everyone knows what’s going to happen. If someone knew your plan, you’re not going to carry it out. So I think it’s just probably a warning and maybe he’s put in as you know, trained all these troops and they will come back next month, come back next year.<br>Putin is trying to see the opportunity. So like with Crimea, when he illegally annexed it in 2014, he’s just looking for that opportunity when the eyes are the West are looking out somewhere and then he will strike over. If everyone knows that he might invade, everyone throwing weapons and everyone is getting ready. The whole Ukrainian population is getting armed then he is not going to do it. He is gonna do it when everyone starts relaxing.<br>I think Putin is just bullying and see what it can get until the final Cliff edge, but that’s dangerous game. So anything, anything that could have started a war. A stray bullet could have started it. It’s kind of living dangerously.</p>



<p>00:05:53.130 –&gt; 00:05:53.890<br>Reporter<br>Living on the edge and is there anything else that you would like to add. All that you’ve not mentioned ’cause I’m not that immersed in it. You know I’m sort of dipping my toe in the water because it’s a big news story at the moment, you know?</p>



<p>00:06:07.730 –&gt; 00:06:12.740<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>Lots of people think, oh, Ukraine, Russia, same people. And so we might have same roots, but we’re not the same people. And it goes back if you go back 1000 years then, and it was, it was a land called the Kievan Rus. And the Kievan Rus was ruled by some kind of Viking kings. That’s how it’s set up.</p>



<p>00:06:32.350 –&gt; 00:06:45.040<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>And Russia at this time wasn’t even started. Meanwhile, Ukraine was being mentioned, people calling their land Ukraine. It was an area of the Kievan Rus.</p>



<p>00:06:45.940 –&gt; 00:06:49.810<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>And it wasn’t until there was some kind of break up with the rulers at that time where one of them went over and formed in the Principality of Moscow, so it wasn’t until after Ukraine was kind of formed until Russia was formed. So Putin with his essay said we are one people: Russia and Ukraine, Maybe that is true, but Ukrainians then have as much claim to Russia as Russia to claiming Ukraine.</p>



<p>00:07:16.860 –&gt; 00:07:23.530<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>We have different cultures and people say, oh, there’s lots of people speaking Russian and Ukraine, that’s true.<br>Well, it’s like people speaking English in and US or anything. It doesn’t mean that they’re English and are the same. There probably would be more Ukrainians speaking Ukrainian. But there was a genocide in 1932 to 1933. I’m not sure if you know, it’s called the Holodomor where Starlin basically took all the wheat produce in the Ukrainian lands. And people starved to death. And that was ethnic cleansing. So once lots of Ukrainians died, forced were lots of ethnic Russians from the Moscow area into Ukraine.<br>And then, of course, they’re going to speak Russian, not Ukrainian. So the actual fact that over there might be Russians in Ukraine. It’s because Ukraine were killed and Russians put there.<br>I think that’s a big misconception that people have.</p>



<p>00:08:30.780 –&gt; 00:08:55.770<br>Reporter<br>Absolutely. So in terms of the amount of stuff that we’re gonna use. We’re very sound bitey so we could, we could talk for way longer, but I won’t be able to use it. So I think probably just to end to kind of going back to this situation that we are seeing and talking about and the reason we’re doing this and if we if you can just summarize then in general.</p>



<p>00:08:59.990 –&gt; 00:09:07.850<br>Reporter<br>How it is our interpretation here and how it will compare to how it feels for the people there?</p>



<p>00:09:08.540 –&gt; 00:09:14.430<br>Peter&nbsp; Stasiw<br>Ukraine, I don’t know how many miles away is. Why should we care? The choice is simple, democracy and peace compared to the opposite, with Putin in the east and dictatorship in Belarus, in the north. That’s basically it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It is headline news that over 100,000 Russian troops are amassed near the Ukraine-Russia border. It does not take a genius to work-out that this is what happens before a war begins. But it is important to note that Ukraine has been fighting a low-intensity hybrid war against Russian forces in its eastern Donbas region, ever since Vladimir Putin, the Russian President, provided arms and resources to ‘separatists’ in east Ukraine – a cover up of the fact that these ‘separatists’ are probably Russian military, wearing Russian military uniform without the insignia. This is also the case in illegally-annexed Crimea. A now erased Russian court case inadvertently confirmed the official existence of Russian regular troops operating in occupied Ukrainian territory.  The only ongoing war in Europe has taken the lives of 14,000 Ukrainians and has displaced millions more.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="2517" src="https://www.peterstasiw.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Map_of_the_war_in_Donbass.svg_.png" alt="" class="wp-image-32"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Military situation in November 2021 | Stalemate since 2015</em></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Ukraine?</h2>



<p>But why is Ukraine so interesting to Putin? Very simple – a buffer zone between democracy and autocracy. Russia sees Ukraine as a battleground for if there was ever a battle between the east and west. In WW2 for example, Ukraine was the main battle ground between the soviets and the axis powers. Why bring the battle to your own border, when you can have Ukraine as a battleground instead? This is the main reason why Putin does not want Ukraine to become a NATO member, as he would never be able to claim Ukraine without a whole NATO alliance getting involved.</p>



<p>Other reasons to conquer Ukraine:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Direct gas pipeline to Europe</li>



<li>Large land mass</li>



<li>25th most powerful army in the world</li>



<li>Join occupied Crimea to the Russian mainland (Crimea was annexed back in 2014, primarily due to its warm-water ports and access to the Black Sea, a place that Russia can use to move its navy year-round whilst its other harbours are frozen in winter. However, Crimea is not self-sufficient, hence the need to join it with Russia)</li>



<li>Natural resources like minerals, oil, coal, natural gas, Uranium (most of which is in the occupied Donbas region)</li>



<li>Extremely fertile land (which is why grain is a major export)</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The History</h2>



<p>History, of course, plays a crucial role in the events of today. Vladimir Putin has revealed in an article he wrote, entitled&nbsp;<em>‘On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians’,&nbsp;</em>as well as in a recent interview, that he believes that Ukrainians and Russians are ‘one people’ and that Ukraine is a ‘breakaway province’ of Russia that should be united through diplomacy or force. On this premise, Ukrainians have the same claim that Russia should be part of Ukraine, rather than Ukraine part of Russia. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union in the 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century and had been absorbed by the Russian Empire before that, leading to an entangled history between the two ethnicities. Yet, it is important to note that most Ukrainians see themselves as distinct from Russians, and have a separate language, culture, and social mindset, as well as a separate independent history, in which Russia is viewed as an oppressive occupying foreign power. Putin seeks to end the embarrassment of the Soviet Union’s collapse and restore ‘historical Russian lands’ to their former glory.</p>



<p>But let us go back a thousand years to the Kyivan Rus. The Kyvian domain of the entire Rus was formed with the help of Normans, and the general Slavic population originating from migration over 100s of years from various places, but definitely not from the North East where Russia is today. See the confusion? ‘Rus’ and ‘Russia’. No one would blame you for making the connection, and this is how Russia like to claim history when they are entirely different. Some Ukrainians even refer to Russians as Muscovites, rather than Russian, and I will explain why.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2250" height="2781" src="https://www.peterstasiw.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/download.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-33"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Kyivan Rus 980-1054 https://euromaidanpress.com/2016/11/05/princess-olha-of-kyiv-a-golden-page-in-ukrainian-history/</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the northeast, Vladimir-Suzdal&nbsp;(and later Moscow) formed the core from which developed the future Russian state. But this state did not form until second half of the 13th century. In addition, it was formed under the leadership of a branch of the Rurik&nbsp;dynasty. The Rurik dynasty were the princes of the Kyivan Rus and descendents of varangian (viking) prince Rurik. Meanwhile, Ukraine was first mentioned in the Hypatian Codex in 1187 as the name of the territory of Pereyaslav Principality meaning “outskirts”, and later the term expanded to other parts of the Kyivan Rus. Ukraine has always been centred around Kyiv (the former capital of the Kyivan Rus), Ukraine stands on much of the historic Kyivan Rus, and Russia is just a later off-branch. Thus, Russia is in fact a break-away province of Ukraine.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The topic of Crimea</h2>



<p>I would argue that Crimea is neither Ukrainian nor Russian, but the land of the Crimean Tatars. Nonetheless, Crimea has been part of Ukraine under autonomous status in harmony with Ukraine. That was until Russia invaded and took over everything. Now Crimea has no autonomy and is ruled by Russia, despite their installation of a puppet government.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Language</h2>



<p>Yes, language laws were passed in Ukraine which requires Ukrainian to be the language of study in state schools. The point of the law is that institutions should use the Ukrainian language. Some laws also have quotas on how many Ukrainian songs should be played on the radio and quotas in other media including books. No one is denying that people speak Russian in Ukraine, but this is exactly the problem. This dilutes the Ukrainian culture, and increases the chance for Russian influence. No one is banning Russian, Ukraine is just putting a limit on it so it cannot take over the culture. It is a right of a country that its citizens use the national language above all others. I, myself, speak Ukrainian at home and watch films with Ukrainian dubbing (when possible), just because of the fact it is a beautiful language.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the claim that Putin is ‘defending Russian speakers’ is false. Many Russian-speaking Ukrainians spoke out against the Kremlin’s military intervention in Ukraine, rejecting Russian claims of any rights violations. Thousands more went even further, taking up arms against Russian hybrid forces in the east of the country.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The verdict</h2>



<p>Putin is a bully. Many Russians do not want war, nor do they want Ukraine. They even took to the streets in 2014 against the start of the war back then. Putin is doing all of these actions to distract the rest of the Russian population from the corruption and scandal of his own government, and even to leave a legacy of conquering another country.</p>



<p>However, Ukrainians are proud, even my gran would pick up a gun and fight if she had to. So if Russia invades, they will be met with extensive resistance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I currently own a Panasonic GH5 and I love it, with its high bitrate recording. But there have been rumours that the next camera the GH6 coming out soon. This GH line-up of cameras uses the micro four thirds sensor (MFT), which is half the size of the full frame sensor of most other mirrorless cameras. The prices of full frame cameras are reducing and they have their advantages. Why should I stay with GH MFT line-up and not switch to the full frame cameras?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Panasonic GH6 Complete Specifications" width="880" height="495" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ax0snEc_9IE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Video with rumoured specifications and debate</em></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reasons for:</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Smaller, lighter and cheaper lenses (smaller sensor requires smaller lenses)</li>



<li>More processing features, because the camera has more space for hardware (such as higher resolution at higher bitrates)</li>



<li>I already own some MFT lenses (so full frame lenses will be an extra expense)</li>



<li>I’m only a amateur camera enthusiast, so I do not need anything OTT</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reasons against:</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Prices of full frame are coming down, when the GH6 is released I anticipate it will be more expensive than an entry-level full frame.</li>



<li>Full frame is much better in the dark</li>



<li>MFT may lose popularity and support for them may diminish</li>



<li>MFT uses depth-from-defocus autofocus which is worse than the mainstream contrast autofocus used in most other cameras.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>We do not have any confirmed specifications yet, and if the price was right I may have bought it. However, as of January 2022, I have bought the Lumix S5, a full frame Panasonic camera. The main reason for this is that even if the GH6 is released, it will never have a full frame sensor, and because there was a deal on the S5, I got it for £1500, cheaper than what the GH6 may sell at.</p>

<p>In the lockdown of 2020, I needed a new hobby. I primarily bought the Panasonic GH5 to do my own videos, as I previously used my iPhone to record videos. The main reason was for the All-I recording mode which enabled no quality degradation until I exported the video after editing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="5184" height="3888" src="https://www.peterstasiw.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Viceroy-Banquet-18.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-25"/></figure>



<p>Nonetheless, the opportunity came to me to work with my brother to take photos for local restaurants, and as I had a decent camera, it made sense. My work is mainly used in social media advertising for these restaurants. Two restaurants <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Manzo-Steak-Grill-2297171277239064/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Manzo</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ViceroyDerby" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Viceroy</a> are the ones I cover at the time of writing</p>
