<p>I currently own a Panasonic GH5 and I love it, with its high bitrate recording. But there have been rumours that the next camera the GH6 coming out soon. This GH line-up of cameras uses the micro four thirds sensor (MFT), which is half the size of the full frame sensor of most other mirrorless cameras. The prices of full frame cameras are reducing and they have their advantages. Why should I stay with GH MFT line-up and not switch to the full frame cameras?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Panasonic GH6 Complete Specifications" width="880" height="495" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ax0snEc_9IE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption>Video with rumoured specifications and debate</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Reasons for:</h2>



<ul><li>Smaller, lighter and cheaper lenses (smaller sensor requires smaller lenses)</li><li>More processing features, because the camera has more space for hardware (such as higher resolution at higher bitrates)</li><li>I already own some MFT lenses (so full frame lenses will be an extra expense)</li><li>I&#8217;m only a amateur camera enthusiast, so I do not need anything OTT</li></ul>



<h2>Reasons against:</h2>



<ul><li>Prices of full frame are coming down, when the GH6 is released I anticipate it will be more expensive than an entry-level full frame.</li><li>Full frame is much better in the dark</li><li>MFT may lose popularity and support for them may diminish</li><li>MFT uses depth-from-defocus autofocus which is worse than the mainstream contrast autofocus used in most other cameras.</li></ul>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>We do not have any confirmed specifications yet, and if the price is right I may have bought it. However, as of January 2022, I have bought the Lumix S5, a full frame Panasonic camera. The main reason for this is that even if the GH6 is released, it will never have a full frame sensor, and because there was a deal on the S5, I got it for Â£1500, cheaper than what the GH6 may sell at.</p>

<p>In the lockdown of 2020, I needed a new hobby. I primarily bought the Panasonic GH5 to do my own videos, as I previously used my iPhone to record videos. The main reason was for the All-I recording mode which enabled no quality degradation until I exported the video after editing. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, the opportunity came to me to work with my brother to take photos for local restaurants, and as I had a decent camera, it made sense. My work is mainly used in social media advertising for these restaurants. Two restaurants <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/Manzo-Steak-Grill-2297171277239064/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.facebook.com/Manzo-Steak-Grill-2297171277239064/" target="_blank">Manzo</a>  and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/ViceroyDerby" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.facebook.com/ViceroyDerby" target="_blank">The Viceroy</a> are the ones I cover at the time of writing. </p>

<p> Looking through YouTube I stumbled across how easy it was to make a website, and have a kind of &#8216;online&#8217; CV. I do have <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/peter-stasiw-6b3b0614b" data-type="URL" data-id="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/peter-stasiw-6b3b0614b">linked in</a>, however, there are some things that are better to explain in more depth. This is my website, and if you&#8217;re reading this, I am glad that you are here. </p>
